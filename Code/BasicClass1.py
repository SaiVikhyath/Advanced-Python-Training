# Create a simple class

    # Class Method Go here

'''
The self

Class methods must have an extra first parameter in method definition
We do not give a value for this parameter when we call the method
Python provides it
If we have a method which takes no arguments, then we still have to have one argument â€“ the self
See func() in above simple example.
This is similar to this pointer in C++ and 'this' reference in Java

What really happens
calling method obj.func() with no arguments auto converted in Python to
obj.func() ==> BasicClass.func(basicClass)

BasicClass.func(basicClass)
calling method obj.func(args) with  arguments auto converted in Python to BasicClass.func(basicClass, args)
